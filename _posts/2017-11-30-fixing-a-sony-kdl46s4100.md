title: Fixing a Sony KDL-46S4100
---

##### Chapter the First: Procurement

I was pleasantly surprised recently to find a 46-inch Sony Bravia LCD TV advertised on Kijiji for $20. The unit was considered defective due to a persistent "white screen." I decided to take the risk, and hitched up the ol' hoss, a small european sedan, and headed out to meet Dave in the deep suburbs where I exchanged 20 of my hard-earned shekels for a Sony KDL-46S4100 television.

Upon my return, it became quickly apparent that I should have drafted a second poor soul into the woeful task of lugging the unit into my apartment, as the one-man handling technique for a 46-inch television is admittedly not the simplest. With considerable effort and a few muttered curses, the television did arrive, intact, in my fifth-floor apartment.

##### Chapter the Second: Disassembly

It has to be said that these large flat-screen televisions are remarkably well built, with all the electronics mounted around a central frame which is itself enclosed by the plastic trim. No actual load is borne by any of the trim, which makes for a more solid foundation. The bezel also isn't held together with those stupid frustrating clips that you can never get off. Good, old fashioned screws are the way to go.
