			<h2>The Calgary Guide App</h2>
			<p>The internationally-respected medical reference is preparing to launch a mobile application. David Olmstead will be leading the project and providing all of the custom code.</p>
			<h4>Phase I</h4>
			<p>The early stages of this project aim to produce a working proof-of-concept mobile application to display cached, offline content from The Calgary Guide. For this early release, the application is only currently planned to be available on the Android platform.</p>
            <div class="alert alert-info"><p class="mb-0"><strong>Timeline:</strong> Summer 2018</p></div>
            <h4>Phase II</h4>
            <p>Analytics will be collected in a similar fashion to the current system used on the Calgary Guide website. Based on uptake, cross-platform development will start with the aim of building a platform-agnostic, more feature-rich version for release.</p>
